AspectJ Example Project
===============

A basic project with AspectJ weaving.

This has an annotation (a nice explicit way of marking methods with advice), that when applied to a class
causes an exception to be throw if system property test.mode.enabled != true.

The Internet is full of examples of AspectJ, so this project is just as shell (archetype?) for AOP projects.
